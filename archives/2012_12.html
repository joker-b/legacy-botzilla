<p>For random fun, here's a little one-day-only (Halloween) splash screen that I had made for a <i>Rift</i> internal build back in 2009 -- before it was called <i>Rift.</i> Ironically, it ended up that there was no build that day! So it was never used.</p>

        <h1><a href="http://www.botzilla.com/blog/archives/000751.html">Shading</a></h1>
        <p><img alt="turner_snow_storm _hannibal_and_his_army_crossing_the_alps.jpg" src="http://www.botzilla.com/blog/archives/pix2012/turner_snow_storm _hannibal_and_his_army_crossing_the_alps.jpg" width="807" height="503" border="0" title="JMW Turner, Hannibal and his Army Crossing the Alps. Feel free to knock this out in ZBrush some time -- yet without those figures at the base, it would be so much smearing" /></p>

<p>As " Senior Technical Artist" on <a href="http://www.riftgame.com" target="new"><i>Rift,</i></a> my tasks often involved the creation of specialized tool software; helping non-technical people within the art dept (usually) solve specific problems; interfacing between the art, management, and engineering groups... But the part of my job that’s been most-visible to game players is <i>shading.</i></p>

<p>The funny thing is that while shading is visible everywhere -- <i>every</i> pixel you see is a shaded one -- shading is a hidden art, like photographic lighting. It rarely has much of a narrative representational thrust of its own. You <i>can</i> make a drawing without shading, just as you can make a photo without any effort or thought about lighting. Yet you'll be hard pressed to find an un-shaded painting (or drawing) in a gallery or museum, just as you'll rarely see photos without very deliberate lighting in those venues, or in portrait or advertising studios; or especially in films, where the creators of those media have long learned and understood the value of careful control over tone, grading, and color. Not just on one costume or in one shot, but across the whole of their dramatic/artistic enterprise.</p>

<p>In computer image creation, shading -- the assignment of colors to pixels at all levels of detail -- is usually accomplished by the use of micro-programs called "shaders." In the case of <i>Rift,</i> I wrote nearly every shader, re-wrote those I didn't initially create, or created the shader-writing software that generated the shaders.</p>

<p>The exact meaning of "shader" can be a bit squirrelly for some. Engineers may prefer to call them "streaming processor functions" because they may not be "shading" visible images at all (see <a href="http://www.gpgpu.org" target="new">Mark Harris's excellent GPGPU.org</a> for some counter-examples). Most of the time, artists use the term "shader" and "material" interchangeably. The difference between a identically-colored materials that look like chalk, or ice, or plastic, or metal, or glowing ooze? The shader.</p>

<p>Shaders and interactions between shaders are also used to create lighting effects, glows, glints, shadows, depth buffers, and more. We'll talk about them as they come along in <a href="http://www.botzilla.com/blog/archives/000750.html" target="new">this series.</a></p>

<p>In the case of <i>Rift,</i> shaders for materials (and other purposes) not only had to look great for the best, high-end computers, they also had to be "heterofunctional": they needed to work on a wide variety of different PC's and in different environments. Some players had top-drawer computers with high-dollar GPU cards, while others had rather modest hand-me-down laptops. It was important to provide the best experience possible -- both pictorially and in terms of playable frame rate -- for all of these many thousands of players, across literally hundreds of material variations.</p>

<p>To complicate matters further, nearly all material shaders needed to have working analogues that run not only in the game as shipped, but also in our art-creation tools. This meant that each material needed its own OpenGL <a href="http://developer.download.nvidia.com/shaderlibrary/webpages/cgfx_shaders.html" target="new">CgFX</a> versions for use in <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/maya/" target="new">Maya,</a> custom preview modes for model building and animation, special DirectX versions for use in our modified <a href="http://www.gamebryo.com/" target="new">Gamebryo 2.6</a> toolchain, some experiments with <a href="http://www.chromeexperiments.com/webgl/" target="new">WebGL</a> and <a href="http://unity3d.com/" target="new">Unity,</a> and of course the various editions for player consumption at varying degrees of performance (at least two, sometimes up to five different versions).</p>

<p>As usual, the way to manage vast complexity is to bite off a little at a time and revise/polish as you go. I used to say (to steal a bit of a metaphor from.. <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html" target="new">Paul Graham?</a> Not sure at this point, but we all steal from the best)  that we started by jumping off a cliff and I built an airplane on the way down.</p>

        <h1><a href="http://www.botzilla.com/blog/archives/000750.html">Rift's End: The Beginning</a></h1>
        <img alt="rift-bear3a.jpg" src="http://www.botzilla.com/blog/archives/pix2012/rift-bear3a.jpg" width="807" height="388" border="0" />


<p>Four years ago I departed a good job at <a
    href="http://developer.nvidia.com" target="new">NVIDIA</a> to join a start-up
games company called <a href="http://www.trionworld.com" target="new">Trion World
    Network</a> -- Trion&rsquo;s plan was to revolutionize online
gaming in the US, and their stated goals were ones that I also shared:
to create a new, innovative, more-immersive and immediate online-gaming
experience.</p>

<p>I really believe that graphics matter. That great art is
more than just simulating realism, and that it goes right to
your emotions without waiting for rational analysis. That
it&rsquo;s those emotions that bring you back again and again
to entertaining experiences, more than DPS and EXP and
leveling-up to get the next BFG. Those are just background. Beautiful, vivid imagery -- even a beautiful image of an ugly subject
-- goes right to the heart of an audience&rsquo;s mind.</p>

<p>Among
games, online ones had to that point been rather poor cousins
in the graphics and art departments, with titles like
<i>Farmville</i> and <i>World of Warcraft.</i> I&rsquo;d had
conversations with developers of other online games who
declared &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t want to do anything more than
Blizzard is doing&rdquo; -- instead of seeing a future of
ubiquitously-cheaper and more powerful machines for
entertainment, they could only see that <i>WoW</i> had
millions of subscribers &amp; thought the only way to proceed
was via a zero-sum &nbsp;&ldquo;WWWD?&rdquo; -- &ldquo;What
Would <i>WoW</i> Do?&rdquo; -- mindset.</p>

<p>Given the fact that game development cycles are now often longer
than hardware-deployment cycles (a next generation of hardware may
appear every year or so, while games to use that hardware take much
longer), this vision gap was increasingly obvious. The future was
being held back by a desire to simply repeat the successes of the
past.</p>

<p>From my evangelist/consulting role at NVIDIA, it seemed like the
shortest route to really show people what a <a
    href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/nvision08-bwotf.html" target="new">beautiful
    online game experience</a> might be like was not to advise the
established developers, but to lead by doing: to simply go and create the
future myself. And so I jumped, just hours before the stock market crash of
2008 got fully underway.</p>

<p>Two and a half years later, <a
    href="http://www.riftgame.com/" target="new"><i>Rift: Planes of Telara</i></a> opened to <a href="http://www.gamerankings.com/pc/995594-rift/index.html" target="new">rave reviews;</a> reviews that nearly always began with accolades about how great the game looked (<a href="http://www.tentonhammer.com/rift/features/review" target="new">Ten Ton Hammer:</a> Graphics 95, &ldquo;outstanding&rdquo;; <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/reviews/8795-Rift-Review" target="new">The Escapist:</a> &ldquo;One area where Rift&nbsp;definitely delivers is the graphics&rdquo;; <a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/12/02/why-you-should-care-about-rift-planes-of-telara" target="new">IGN:</a> &ldquo;an undeniably gorgeous game&rdquo;; etc).</p>

<p>We continued to ramp it up for future revisions: so much so that
previewers of &nbsp;the first expansion set, <i>Rift: Storm Legion,</i>
expressed their excitement about the &ldquo;new renderer&rdquo; (there
was no new renderer, but I&rsquo;d upgraded nearly all of the lighting
and atmospherics code). When the expansion was released it received
similar critical praise, such as this <a
    href="http://gamingtrend.com/game_reviews/rift-storm-legion-review-everything-you-want-in-an-expansion/" target="new">review
    from <i>Gaming Trend:</i></a> &ldquo;[<i>Storm Legion</i> has]
<i>the best looking things in gaming, period, right now.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p><b><i>Quest Completed! You are dead.</i></b></p>

<p>However, the executives at Trion had a very different view. In
December 2012, just a very few weeks after the release of <i>Storm
    Legion,</i> despite the superlative reception, they laid off a big chunk (most?)
of the remaining <i>Rift</i>-focused art team: forty people including
myself. If I were to speculate, the company seems to be backing away
from &ldquo;Triple-A&rdquo; content focus and moving toward licensing
deals with other production companies along with a focus on smaller,
faster-iterating projects. Less &ldquo;vision of the future of
entertainment&rdquo; and more same-ol&rsquo; game publishing.
That&rsquo;s just speculation on my part, but they&rsquo;ve certainly
reduced their ability to create top-shelf experiences like <i>Rift</i> in the
short term future. Speculation.</p>

<p>While I&rsquo;m not happy with the choices of management, I hope
<i>Rift</i> continues to find an audience -- the whole point was to
make something worth showing and sharing, a better gaming experience
than what had been offered by anyone before. The effort means nothing
if no one gets to experience the world we&rsquo;ve created.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also decided to write a series here on some of the
challenges and solutions in my process of collaboratively creating and
tweaking the artwork and graphics for the game. While most of the art
department has already been publicizing their work, as in this <a
    href="http://www.polycount.com/forum/showthread.php?t=112686" target="new">Polycount
    Art Dump,</a> we were specifically forbidden from revealing
&ldquo;technical details.&rdquo; Which means that if your work is
nearly <i>all</i> technical details, well... you&rsquo;re not allowed to talk
about your work! Now I can. Watch this space.</p></body></html>

<p>Acros has a unique snap, described well by one early reviewer as "metallic." I've never run any charts on it, but suspect it's just that it blocks-up in the highlights, similar to slide film. Anyone know?</p>

<p>I can say this much &#151; dries faster than Kodak, probably due to the plastic film base. This is ready to scan and sleeve after 4-5 hours, while the Tmax is still a wee bit sticky and still hanging.</p>

<p>Such democratization's most-obvious expression, its adherents might say, is the <a href="http://www.photoblogs.org/" target="linkframe">photoblog.</a> There's no obvious shortage of them &#151;a href="http://www.photoblogs.org/" target="linkframe">photoblogs.org</a> currently lists over 1100, with new ones being added four or five each day.</p>

<p>The aforementioned site bills itself as a guide to "high-quality photoblogs." Their definition of "high quality" leaves me skeptical. They cite four criteria in their <a href="http://www.photoblogs.org/faq/" target="linkframe">FAQ</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Photo Quality</li>
<li>Interface</li>
<li>Photo Freshness</li>
<li>Photo Quantity</li>
</ol>

<p>The sub-criterion for "quality" is simply stated "are the photos well done?" For the sake of democratic breadth (or was it really to patronize demographics?), they seem to be aiming awfully low.</p>

<p>The last two are more troublesome, because they imply that volume equates to quality.  Personally, I'd rather find a website with two amazing photos than a website that floods the webspace with hundreds of repetetive and uninspired ones. Yet it's precisesly the latter type that seems to dominate, with "new photos every day" being held-aloft as the zenith of photographic excellence.</p>

<p>It's a disease that seems to have infected even sites like <a href="http://www.21mm.net/" target="linkframe">21mm.net</a> where there are genuinely good photos amid a mass of banal ones. Are the photobloggers simply unable to distinguish?</p>

<p>One might argue that this torrent of "unaffected" imagery is needed in order to create some as-yet-unnamed New Aesthetic &#151; I find it more fashion statement than artistic movement. The photos I find in the top100 sites all seem to cave-into the pattern of "conform and confirm," either pounding on familiar safe notions (flowers and vividly-colored fruits, one-light nudes on black, raggedly texture-filled homeless people), or worse getting caught-up in the factory-manufactured signifiers of "quirky" and "independant" photography (toy cameras & lomos, cross-processing, rock bands).</p>

<p>I wonder if anyone has yet undertaken any kind of sustained, rigourous attempt to deconstruct the photoblogiverse.</p>

        <h1><a href="http://www.botzilla.com/blog/archives/000010.html">Old Ho's Last Laugh</a></h1>
        <p>Back in the 1960's, there was an episode when Lyndon Johnson suggested offering North Vietnam a large dose of western-style incentive, as a deal to secure the peace. Cash and know-how to build hydroelectic power reservoirs in Vietnam, thinking it would transform the region into Tennessee-on-the-Mekong.</p>

<p>"Ol' Ho just can't turn <i>that</i> down!" Johnson is reported to have gleefully proclaimed, before the plan was rejected by the Vietnamese.</p>

<p>I have thought often of this story whenever I heard politicians talking about Iraqis' supposed willingness to turn themselves into happily westernized "free" consumers as a result of the coming (now current, and stalled) invasion. That this sentiment is repeated without question by CNN is no surprise &#151; was Ted Turner who had similarly sappy (though similiarly self-serving) ideas about world-peace-through-global-TV-networks only a few short years ago (as if feeding folks in Yemen and Somalia the same re-runs of <i>Gilligan's Island</i> as those beamed to hapless American children would somehow make the human condition more bearable).</p>

<p>For a moment there in Afghanistan, I actually thought there was a chance that the US would "get it" &#151; that achieving military objectives wouldn't change the region's inherent core of <a href="http://www.rferl.org/nca/features/2001/11/20112001095314.asp" target="linkframe"><i>Pashtun-Wali</i></a> beliefs, and that it was best to let people follow their own courses, albeit in some way that would be harmless to the US, while realizing that it would never <i>be</i> the US. Forget that, I guess.</p>

<p>There has been a huge apparent ignorance of the underlying <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/saddam.htm" target="linkframe">al-Tikriti</a> foundation of the Ba'ath Party government, a foundation that goes back to well before Saddam unambiguously took the helm in 1979. Surely the State Department and Pentagon had plenty of people who must have had some clue as to the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/2002/05/bowden.htm" target="linkframe">social order of which Saddam was merely a symptom.</a> And that someone could have done the math: if the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/1992/Iraq926.htm" target="linkframe">rebelling Iraqis of 1991 were erased <i>en masse,</i></a> then who was left behind to inherit Basra? And more, have they forgotten <a href="http://www.iraqfoundation.org/reports/spec/fjun28_00_revolt.html" target="linkframe">how the country of Iraq itself was created</a> as the result of a 1920 <i>fatwa</i> that unified both Sunnis and Shias, declaring it against Koranic law for muslims to be ruled by infidels? In particular, the British, who only three years ealier had promised the Iraqi that they [the Brits] were there as "liberators"?</p>

<p>Saddam is an intolerable beast, to be sure. But the planners in Washington and Whitehall who replaced thinking with wishes had best be prepared for a formidable backlash from the families of the soldiers whose lives have been so capriciously threatened and lost by those planners' hubris.</p>

Scanning/printing to adjust makes all the difference.</p>

<p>Took me until tonight to even begin to look in detail at the first of the rolls from a couple of nights back. Previously I just grabbed a frame from the end of the roll and rushed it through. Been really slammed on schedule at work, and the process of reviewing scans has been slow. The slogging part, ironically, is the computer &#151; takes time, even on a fast computer, to pick through photos in detail, and the little 200-px sized thumbnails are no replacement for a clean, hi-res viewing.</p>

<p>On the way back from errands <a href="http://www.geekychick.net" target="linkframe">Courtney</a> &amp; I stopped at Kamera Korner in SJ and bought some Dektol. Looks like the darkroom is poised to rise again, after a long hiatus...</p>

After <i>Final Flight</i> I shifted my attention from <a href="http://www.arstechnica.com/wankerdesk/01q3/ff-interview/ff-interview-1.html" target="linkframe">production on a massive scale</a> to <a href="/photo/DawnMaya.html">doing it all on your PC</a> (and every scale in between).  I've been hammering furiously at the latest release of the <a href="http://developer.nvidia.com/view.asp?PAGE=cg_main" target="linkframe">CgFX plugins</a> for <a href="http://www.aliaswavefront.com/" target="linkframe">Maya</a> and <a href="http://www.discreet.com/" target="linkframe">3ds Max.</a> I hate to sound like an ad but for <i>me,</i> this stuff is hecka great &#151; lets you work-out ideas about light, shading, and texture really quickly and fluidly. I'm really keen to get one of the upcoming GeForce FX Go laptops &#151; studio!</p></p>

<p><p>(Now if I can just find a way to wedge 150 artists into that same suitcase....)</p></p>

        <h1><a href="http://www.botzilla.com/blog/archives/000005.html">Back to the Delta</a></h1>
        <p><img src="/bpix/mar03h-29.jpg" width=300 height=193 title="Santa Clara, CA (C)2003 Kevin Bjorke" hspace=6 vspace=4 align="right"><i>Xtol 1::1, 11.5 mins @ 20C. About 18C, make that 12.5 mins. Three rolls @ ISO 400.</i></p>

<p>After a four-month fling with Neopan 400 Presto (aka Neopan Professional), as of this batch I'm back to Ilford Delta. The Fuji is great stuff, easily pushed, crisp, contrasty. I picked some up in a corner store in <a href="../photo/T2002/">Tokyo,</a> having run out of Ilford. I was delighted with the results, but Delta has a smooth tone and latitude that I've grown used to. And I can actually find it bulkrolled in the store.</p>

<p>I ran the Fuji through a battery of tests &#151; to ISO 200, pushed to 800, 1600, 3200. Xtol, Rodinal. For web purposes, running it at 800 was perfectly fine &#151; for reasonably-sized printing. Good for an overcast winter. The last dozen rolls were all shot that way.</p>

<p>In going back to Delta I've realized that I hadn't done any methodical examination on it since first shooting the old version, almost a decade ago. So it's overdue! Hopefully over the next few days I can run a few rolls for the sake of the same tests &#151; do some more-formal comparisons on Tmax 100 too (Acros is <i>really</i> great but hard to find around here and <i>never</i> in bulk). <a href="http://www.contaximages.com/user.php?id=2">Rich</a> has said he'd like to go out shooting in Marin sometime soon... hmm</p>

<p>Two rolls of unprocessed Neopan still sitting in the "need to process" box. One marked "Jan03K." Tsk.</p>

        <p><p>I had no idea how many <a title="The Raving Atheist" href="http://ravingatheist.com/">atheist blogs</a> there were. I've no doubt there numbers are dwarfed by religious sites of every brand, but it's encouraging to see a number of voices out there.</p></p>

<p><p>Then again, if there are enough of either stripe then I suppose they can all blogroll each other and never notice the other world's existence... is this a good thing?</p></p>

        <p><p><a href="/photo/journal/feb03i-30.html"><img src="/bpix/feb03i-30.jpg" title="Ministry of Sound, London (C)2003 Kevin Bjorke" width=187 height=300 align="right" hspace=8 vspace=6 border=0></a>Folks are occasionally surprised to hear that I acquired my 35mm <a href="http://contaxg.com/user.php?id=1678">Contax G</a> in early 2002, a year <i>after</i> my digital <a href="/photo/G1links.html">Canon G.</a> I got the digital in the hope of supplanting my 35mm SLRs, but instead found it in turn supplanted by a 35mm rangefinder.</p></p>

<p><p>I tried to carry the digital every day &#151; every day I found myself losing shots. Now I carry the Contax every day, and the sense of lost shots is far more rare.  It's simply more capable: instant-on, predictable focus, dependable, fast.</p></p>

<p><p>I expect to return to the digicam fold sooner or later, of course &#151; fact I get terribly impatient with it. I ran into <a href="http://www.echeng.com/photo/">Eric Cheng</a> over the weekend &#151; was toting-along the current leader of the pack, a Canon D1s with a hefty zoom. It looked reasonably fast, and even pretty quiet. The color from it looks crisp and clear. But it's still huge & costs more than a new Kia. Argh.</p></p>

<p><p>C'mon Contax/Minolta/Konica/Nikon, where's that "digital Hexar"????</p></p>

<p><p>Ah well, time to stop typing & go get fixer on my fingers.</p></p>

        <h1><a href="http://www.botzilla.com/blog/archives/000120.html">Begun, It Has</a></h1>
        <p>The new war in Iraq has given us the chance to see some hot news stories that our keenly-suspicious eye might've not otherwise caught. No, not about <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/2002/05/bowden.htm">Saddam</a> or <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/iraq/view/">Bush</a> but about the <i>real</i> force in the Gulf: the treacherous <a href="http://www.albawaba.com/news/index.php3?sid=242849&lang=e&dir=news">invisible forces</a> that control life across the globe from the shadows. Thank goodness for a <a href="http://www.ateg.org/conferences/c6/salih.htm">literate society</a> where the <a href="http://www.rsf.org/">free press</a> can get these important issues out in the open. Personally, I suspect the war isn't truly about WMD or liberation at all &#151; are just TV-friendly canards. It's just a cover-up to keep the media busy so that the truly important stories are drowned-out and ignored.</p>

<p>While I was typing <a href="/blog/archives/000390.html">Pt I</a> (without even thinking that it would become Pt I), part of the paradox vexing me was there on the desk, staring intently from the cover of the January <a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/"><cite>PDN</cite></a> in the form of Jude Law, shot in classicly-crisp B&W by <a href="www.davidbaileyphotography.com/">David Bailey,</a> with the tag: "The Legends Issue." So here we have Jude Law, promoting <cite>Alfie</cite> and dressed-up in 60's Saville Row. Knockout pic, but &#151; part of The Problem of B&W Nostalgia, right?</p>

<p>The "Legends" in PDN have a little gallery <a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/photodistrictnews/feature/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000768964">here</a> &#151; Bailey, <a href="http://digitaljournalist.org/issue0205/donna_intro.htm">Donna Ferrato</a>, <a href="http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/David_Winton_Bell_Gallery/lyon.html">Danny Lyon</a>, and <a href="http://www.junebateman.com/artists/plachy/abt.html">Sylvia Plachy.</a> Last year's Legends Issue included <a href="http://www.terra.com.br/sebastiaosalgado/">Sebastaio Salgado</a>, who was mentioned on the last post's comments. </p>

<p>Such "Legends" present their own paradox &#151; photographers who continue to do new and inspiring work even as the world seems to be moving off in some other direction. Plachy's last couple of books, for example, have knocked me flat &#151; terrific, inspiring, humbling stuff throughout. But are artists like these exceptions partly because they can carry that history with them like a shield?</p>

<p>The problem that was picking at me in the previous entry really was: <i>where are the great new B&W photographers?</i></p>
        <a name="more"></a>
        <p>I admit, I'm showing some awkward bias here. Why is <i>new</i> so important? Maybe it's not. There are plenty of folks for whom pictures are pictures. The subject of my pondering is black and white work that isn't the continuation of work begun long ago, and simultaneously work that doesn't lean so heavily on nostalgia for its interest and authority. As the ever-contentious <a href="http://www.beeflowers.com/">Bee</a> pointed out, for him all B&W that he sees these days he considers "morally suspect." As much as I hate it, I'm more than a little inclined to agree with him.</p>

<p>Years ago Walker Evans derided color, saying it "sentimentalized" images. He chose not to use it. Today, due to changing fashion, it seems like it's B&W that all too often sentimentalizes.</p>

<p>Deuce of it is, I <i>love</i> black and white.</p>

<p>Salgado's latest project (and his last, he claimed when he visited <a href="http://www.fotovision.org/pages/home.php">fotovision</a>/UCBerkeley a few months back), <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/salgado"><cite>Genesis</cite></a>, is shot on B&W film. One assumes the Tri-X he's long admired, probably run by the same lab in Europe, developed by inspection in Rodinal. But even Salgado has bent, releasing his well-loved Leicas for a 6x7 camera (the better, one assumes, to create the large, detailed images that recent technological changes have brought to the art and publishing worlds).</p>

<p>Salgado loves black and white. Says he doesn't know what else to do (though he certainly has worked in color back in his working-PJ days). Some other established shooters, like <a href="http://www.magnumphotos.com/c/htm/TreePf_MAG.aspx?Stat=Photographers_Portfolio&E=29YL53UIS@8">Josef Koudleka,</a> have said much the same thing. It's hard to imagine, say, <a href="http://www.keithcarterphotographs.com/">Keith Carter</a> or <a href="http://www.michaelkenna.net/">Michael Kenna</a> prints in color. Some folks just love black and white, and always will (for me it is the natural color for photos, and color is more an <i>addition</i>). YMMV, but fashionable or no, those people will make (are making) the next great B&W pictures.</p>

<p>In the same magazine rack beneath the <cite>PDN</cite> were a few recent issues of <a href="http://www.shotsmag.com/"><cite>Shots.</cite></a> A great thing about <cite>Shots</cite> is its pattern of growth and change even as it has changed hands &#151; I can still remember when it was crudely pasted-up by hand, printed on newsprint, and now under <a href="http://www.russelljoslin.com/">Russell Joslin</a> it's still not the slick reproduction-fest of the relatively-conservative <a href="http://www.lenswork.com/"><cite>Lenswork</cite></a> or uber-conservative <a href="www.bandwmag.com"><cite>B&W</cite></a>, but Russell keeps getting The Good Stuff. Instead of seeking-out new B&W work, good work seeks out <cite>Shots,</cite> because people can recognize what a Labor of Love it is.</p>

<p>The new self-portrait issue (87) is no exception, including not only <a href="http://pdngallery.com/gallery/pdns30/2005/index.htm">PDN's 30</a> winner (for color!) <a href="http://www.cigharvey.com/">Cig Harvey</a> but innovative B&W champs like <a href="http://www.arnorafaelminkkinen.org/">Arno Rafael Minkkinen</a> (if you can, check out Arno's <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/egg/index.html">Egg</a> episode, too).</p>

<p>(and on the subject of the PDN 30, I was remiss not to post links to the three B&W portfolios: <a href="http://www.dbanderson.com/">Dave Anderson</a> (also interviewed in <cite>Shots 85</cite>), journalist <a href=" http://www.casperdalhoff.com">Casper Dalhoff</a> and editorial shooter <a href=" http://www.matthewpillsbury.com">Matthew Pillsbury</a>)</p>

<p>The toy-cam and "Antiquarian Avant-Garde" revival movements (often falling into nostalgic traps, but not universally) sometimes show up in <cite>Shots</cite> too: an older issue interviewed <a href="http://www.eyecaramba.com">Gordon Stettinus</a> and of course who can forget the "new dags" crowd, most-famously <a href="http://www.newdags.com/jerry.html">Jerry Spagnoli,</a> who was working hard at alternative process long <a href="http://www.iphotocentral.com/news/issue_view.php/24/26">before</a> his famous 9/11 photo (and its impressive auction price).</p>

<p>Great B&W that doesn't try to ape HCB, Weston, or Ansel <i>is</i> out there. We still have <a href="http://www.digitaljournalist.org/issue0501/delano.html">James Whitlow Delano</a>, <a href="http://w.ropp.free.fr/">William Ropp</a>, <a href="http://www.lensculture.com/titarenko.html">Alexei Titarenko</a>, <a href="http://www.lensculture.com/cowen.html">Jeff Cowen</a>, <a href="http://www.mdf.ru/english/special/project24/spbaroque/">Igor Lebedev</a>... Life is good.</p>

<p>If you have more suggestions for B&W that should not be missed, please post them here.</p>

<p><hr align="center" width="20%"></p>

<p>A few days ago <a href="http://www.jmcolberg.com/weblog/archives/001517.html">Joerg</a> pointed out the self-congratulatory <a href="http://www.photobloggies.org/">PhotoBloggies.</a> They have a variety of categories, including nominations for "Best Black and White Photography of a Photoblog: Recognizing the best photoblog featuring mainly black and white images- digital or scanned from film." Funny that they feel they have to qualify film or digital in this category. Sadly, only two of the five finalists even meet the stated entrance criteria (ah, awards... who said popularity was only important in middle school? Oh yeah, high school students, dissed by <a href="http://odds-and-ends.net/archives/2005/03/11/index.html">college students</a>. It all comes back to me now).</p>

<p>Of the remaining finalists, I personally voted for <a href="http://leveckis.net/journal/">Ed Leveckis</a> with <a hrf="http://mute.rigent.com">rigent</a> close behind.</p>

<p>For Toy Cameras I'd go with <a href="http://gordisdead.blogspot.com/">Gord Is Dead</a> and overall for <a href="http://orbit1.com/">Orbit1.</a></p>

<p>Not that anyone in that voting crowd's listening to me.</p>

          <p>Can I suggest Fay Godwin's B&W landscape work (http://www.djclark.com/godwin/landmarks/index.html)? These days she doesn't just restrict herself to B&W but that's what she is best known for. These are B&W landscapes that have little to do with Ansel Adams grandeur; she is usually very recognizably English - almost a precursor to Martin Parr (without the gaudy tackiness) but with the same unflattering but absolutely English soul and sensibility that is difficult to put into words (I guess that's why there's photography after all). I do have a sentimental soft-spot for her work because one of her shows was the first real exhibition I saw as a coming of age teenager in 80's, northern England but her images seem to have grown with me and she's not someone you hear much about, not in the US least ways.</p>

          <p>Thanks for your kind comment regarding my site, I have to say it means a lot to me. I agree with your number one choice though, I think leveckis' work is outstanding, streets ahead of anyone else in that category if I'm being honest. I voted for him.</p>

<p>As for BW photography I enjoyed looking through the links you provided to work I haven't seen before. I love Jeff Cowan's work and Alexey Titarenko's long exposures are amazing! I'd love to see some of his prints.</p>

<p>Would it be gauche to suggest the work of the photojournalist James Nachtwey?</p>

          <p>Just wanted to say, you've got some of the best writing in the photoblogging world. It's wonderful to read a photoblog that has some vague idea of photographic context and history.</p>

<p>Plus you've convinced me to hunt for a Contax G2 and get more into this whole crazy film camera with real silver black and white thing!</p>

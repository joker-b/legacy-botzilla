<p><b>If It Has a Ringtone, It's Not a Camera.</b> Panasonic Lumix's advertising slogan didn't last long -- not, I think, because there would soon enough be a<a href="http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2010/10/05/ceatec-2010-panasonics-new-lumix-cell-phone-up-and-close/"> Lumix-branded mobile phone,</a> but because it's a slogan that can easily be interpreted either way: that a celphone is less than a camera, or (oops) that a camera is potentially rather less than a cameraphone.</p>

<p>It's also less than a "camera-puter," which is an aspect that is neither camera nor phone.</p>

<p>In the simplest sense, the camputer is a portal for images direct from your hand to the internet. But what about pictures before they ever leave the phone? <i>If</i> they ever leave the phone?</p>

                  <p>The utilitarian camera-as-scratchpad notion that's been spreading since the advent of home video (even, for a few, on Super 8) is now something that almost everyone takes for granted. End a meeting with a whiteboard full of scribbles that might be useful later? No time to copy them in a notepad? Use the camera phone. Want to keep a snap of the good-for-once haircut? Want to remember that the car is parked on Level 4 Blue zone? Easy and the photos just as easily cast off when they're done.</p>

<p>Camphone as agent of political change? The jury's out on its genuine effectiveness, but certainly it's had a huge and unpredictable effect on the relations of people, governments, politicians, and the media between them.</p>

<p>Beyond these "useful" applications, though, and beyond the camphone's replacement of point and shoots for a quick facebook-upload fix -- are there new ideas that might be useful creatively? The rapid spread of programs like <a href="http://hipstamaticapp.com/">Hipstamatic</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=1&sqi=2&ved=0CB8QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fneilandtheresa.co.uk%2FAndroid%2FVignette%2F&rct=j&q=vignette%20android&ei=HCtJTeHMLYiqsAPa5fDPCg&usg=AFQjCNEH0-XahhaYyHGmxdXHA6CfJHexAQ&cad=rja">Vignette</a> (or even <a href="http://www.intsig.com/home/us">CamScanner</a>) provide a hint to one other direction, closer to usual photographic practice -- the collapse/reversal of the traditional photo workflow. Sure, you could already take a digital photo and then push it through Photoshop to alter the character of the color and contrast, emulating the look of a particular film stock. The patterns were still the same: capture, process, and (potentially) presentation.</p>

<p>The advent of processing tricks <i>in the camera application</i> collapse the first two steps into one. Just set the camera on "Velvia" and go find some fall foliage. Heck, put the processing and border-generating on "shuffle."</p>

<p>Or even shoot with a <i>different</i> camera and import the images into your <i>phone,</i> rather than spend $500 on Photoshop: which is just what is happening <a href="http://blog.leica-camera.com/guest-blog-post/going-pro-lara-rossignol-tests-the-d-lux-5/">here</a> -- cited by Leica, no less. Established commercial photographer <a href="http://www.rossignolfoto.com/">Laura Rossignol</a> shooting on a <a href="http://en.leica-camera.com/photography/compact_cameras/d-lux_5/">D-Lux 5</a> (aka <a href="http://panasonic.net/avc/lumix/compact/lx5/index.html">Lumix LX5</a>), and then (after doing selects in Lightroom) "I like to take the post processing one step further and I will email a finished version to myself so I can open it in the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pictureshow/id324243655?mt=8">Picture Show</a> iPhone app. It allows you to add interesting effects and frames." </p>

<p><i>(Addendum: Adobe's <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/2011/01/why-would-you-want-to-create-on-a-tablet.html">John Nack made a similar post</a> to this one, wondering: why would you edit on a mobile device?, just a few days ago....)</i></p>

<p>I used to think that the transparency or negative was the canonical object. As Ansel Adams wrote about it, the negative was like a musical score, to be interpreted by a darkroom performance for each new print. <i>Throw that idea away.</i> Immediate darkroom-ish styling on the fly: whether you think they're insanely great or sentimentally godawful, they're as fundamental a part of the New Beast's nature as is the thickness of oil paint or a trumpet's high notes. Get used to it, this is still just an early wave.<br />

<p>I'll be the first to say that I find most Holga/Diana-wana-be photgraphy cloying and twee and it's pretty rare that even the most earnest results feel like anything more than just a rehash of <a href="http://www.foundobjectsgallery.com/bartender/2008/02/07/nancy-rexroth/">Nancy Rexroth's "IOWA."</a> So you can imagine my reflex reaction to programs that deliberately "crappify" otherwise-clear, direct images, burying them under just so much mannered noise. And you'd be right, at least about my initial reaction. Why my attitude has changed in the <a href="/blog/archives/000732.html">next photorant entry.</a></p>

<p>In the mean time, since I couldn't find one that entirely suited me, here are a couple of guides to the color modes (and below, frame styles) offered as presets by the Android camera-phone program <a href="http://neilandtheresa.co.uk/Android/Vignette/"><i>Vignette.</i></a> A similar chart can be found <a href="http://www.schussman.com/article/great-android-apps-vignette">here,</a> but it was missing skin tones). </p>

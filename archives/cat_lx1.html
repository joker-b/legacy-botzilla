        <h1>LX2 Part 2</h1>

        <p><img alt="P1000202-crop-807.jpg" src="https://www.botzilla.com/blog/pix2008/P1000202-crop-807.jpg" width="807" height="512" border="0" /></p>

<p>As I expected, I've gotten more used to the <a href="https://www.botzilla.com/blog/archives/000642.html">LX2.</a></p>

<p>In the clich&eacute;d and time-honored tradition of pointing Leicas at brick walls to prove that their lenses are top-notch, here's a closer sample of an in-camera-sepia JPEG. The right-hand area shows a detail from the picture on the left -- pixels at one-to-one size (if anything, the image here is degraded just because it's a web-compressed pic. It was also hand-held).</p>

<p>As long as I'm willing to put my thumb on the monitor, it's fine in the hand. During the past week I've been shooting with it at the <a href="http://www.ionconference.com/">ION Conference,</a> using it as a notepad to keep track of presentation slides. In the hand for an hour at a time and I've gotten used to the idea. No hand strain. In JPEG, it's also plenty fast.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I'm taking Gary's advice and trying a much faster SD card for shooting in RAW mode. If it can get the differentials indicated on <a href="http://www.robgalbraith.com/bins/multi_page.asp?cid=6007">Rob Galbraith's</a> benchmark site, there might be as much as a 4x acceleration, which will keep me quite happy (even a modest improvement might be enough).<br />

        <h1>LX2</h1>

        <p><img alt="P1000304.jpg" src="https://www.botzilla.com/blog/pix2008/P1000304.jpg" width="807" height="454" border="0" title="Same wall, different sensor" /></p>

<p>After returning from China I gave myself a few weeks to see if Panasonic would announce a new LX3 at February's camera-business trade show. No dice, so I promptly ordered a new LX2 to replace the stolen <a href="https://www.botzilla.com/blog/archives/000476.html">LX1</a>. Here are a few notes, comparing the two.<br />
</p>

                  <p>Only the LX1 camera, one card & one battery were pickpocketed -- my case & charger, 2nd battery & backup card were still in my luggage. Not surprisingly, everything fits perfectly, equipment-wise. Perhaps with time I'll also learn to adjust as smoothly.</p>

<p>The lens is the same killer Leica 28-105-ish. I have been impressed with the improved color renditions, and I don't mind the slightly different character of the in-camera JPEGs (I also don't buy the notion, proposed by some bloggers and others on photo.net, that the LX2's "Venus III" chip does pre-processing on its RAW data -- an assertion that makes no sense to me).</p>

<p>The higher ISOs (two extra stops, from 400 to 1600 as the top end) are a very welcome addition, regardless of how noisy the highest ones may be. A sharp grainy photo is better than an unreadable blur or no photo at all. </p>

<p>I might yet <a href="https://www.botzilla.com/blog/archives/000479.html">tape the back of the camera</a> for grip as I did the LX1 -- but not the front. The LX2's front finger grip is much-improved in providing your middle finger purchase. Simple, and well-done -- but it needs to counter a downside change, hands-wise: to accommodate the larger LCD screen, the LX2's designers have cramped the rear-side controls. It's harder to shift your (my) thumb around and hit the correct thing in that smaller space.</p>

<p>If I want to hold the camera firmly, one-handed, I end up with my thumb on the screen (and away from the buttons). I am pretty sure that I only rarely used the LX1 one-handed, so this difference may feel like a bigger deal than it is.</p>

<p>Overall, the narrower thumb space means that my hand is significantly less comfortable when holding the camera "at rest," and that in turn creates the (false) impression that the LX2 is heavier.</p>

<p>The controls themselves have been subtly improved, mainly by Panasonic's UI designers realizing that people confuse the joystick with the directional buttons -- so, whenever sensible, you can use <i>either</i> control to accomplish the same task. This is good usability design, thinking about what the user wants to accomplish and letting them get there in the way most natural for them. A+</p>

<p>The biggest impression of difference between the LX1 and LX2, however, has been speed of operation -- or rather, the lack of it. The LX2 is slower between shots. I would have guessed about 25% slower, which matches change in the pixel count. <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/PanasonicLX2/page5.asp">dpreview's test</a> shows a 32% slowdown on RAW writes, as well as a slowdown in burst mode. Those percentages <i>feel</i> like a lot, given the rhythm I'd already developed with the LX1. This is frustrating given that the camera's operations are otherwise responsive and the AF is even a tiny bit quicker. That extra second and a half of write time can be tough.</p>

<p><i>Token LX1 sighting: I saw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvia_Plachy">Sylvia Plachy</a> using one on Ovation's televison bio <a href="http://www.ovationtv.com/programs/programdetail.aspx?id=477&genre=3&subgenre=16&genre_name=art"><i>Close Up.</i></a> She was switching back and forth during the same session between an LX1, a Leica M, a Rolleiflex, and a Hasselblad 500 of some sort (SWC?).</i></p>

<p>I realized as I was heading into Oslo that my meeting might be bumped by a local holiday &#151; my dad would probably scold me for being a bad Norwegian, the 17th of May is <i>the holiday,</i> it's christmas and thanksgiving and the fourth of july. The whole city was shut down, busses not running, taxis allowed to charge exorbitant fees legally (otherwise the drivers would stay home for the holiday), and as far as I could tell everyone in southern Norway below the age of 20 or above the age of 40 (and most of those in between too)  crammed into a dozen blocks or so of central Oslo.</p>

<p>The Bronica gots its chance for a workout: ran about seven rolls of 220 Tri-X and Fujicolor and a little Acros to sweeten the mix (okay, I ran out of Tri-X). And filled two cards with the LX1 without shooting a single RAW frame.</p>

<p>Among the marching band hilights were covers of most recent famous Disney songs, a bit of ABBA, a slice of Sousa, and, just as they were passing the royal stand and waving at King Harald V, one school band broke out with their rendition of "That Dude Looks Like a Lady." I started running hoping to catch a video clip, but they were a block behind me &#151; a block filled with 5000 hip-hurra-ing parents.</p>

<p>Once the city busses were running again in the evening, I limped back to my hotel out in Lysaker (Fornebu) and promptly crashed until 2AM, just in time to prep for a visit to the Oslofjord for the 4AM sunrise.</p>

<p>More on the <a href="/blog/archives/000479.html">LX1:</a></p>

<p>I'm finding that the UnRAW files &#151; that is, the JPGs stored with the RAW files &#151; are often what I end up using instead of the RAW image. The RAW gets pumped through ACR, which wants to interpret and optimise (or encourage me to do so). The JPG is more often than not what I was shooting in the first place. Funny, but I'm starting to see the RAW as mainly a backup in case I screwed up (or the contrast range was <i>way</i> out of line).</p>

<p>I've come across a few more scattered LX1 links.</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://www.bernardmarks.com/">Bernard Marks</a> is sponsored by Leica. I recognize at least one of his photos from <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/">NatGeo.</a> The ad copy claims he uses a DLux2 and an M6, but there's no tellling which (if any) of the shots on his site were made with the digi.</li>

<li>Flag-obsessed shooter Daniel Creighton got excited by <a href="http://www.dcphotog.com/lx1day1/index.htm">his first day using the LX1.</a></li>

<li>Here's a more <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/lx1/interesting/"><i>interesting</i> LX1 flickr link.</a></li>

<li>Some links comparing the Panasonic LX1 and Leica DLux2: <a href="http://www.prophotocommunity.com/ubbthreads/showflat.php?Number=388318">discussion on Galbraith</a> and <a href="http://www.lexa.ru/andyt/DMC-LX1_vs_D-LUX2/">comparative pictures.</a></li></ul>

        <h1>Hacking the LX1</h1>

        <p><img alt="P1000976.jpg" src="https://www.botzilla.com/blog/archives/pix2006/P1000976.jpg" width="807" height="454" border="0" /></p>

<p>After some time using it daily, I can recognize my own way of working with the LX1, so it seems time to share some rambling notes. Operationally, electrically, and optically the camera is identical to the Leica D-Lux2 &#151; these notes apply equally well to both cameras.</p>

<p>Let me start why saying why I bought the LX1. I knew that it would be slower to use than a DSLR, but I wanted a high-quality compact. A friend at work was raving about his DLux2, and I checked out the Panasonic alternative but wasn't feeling a need to buy anything at the time. A couple of weeks later, I saw a very cool camera at Fry's and realized that this was the same camera I'd been web-browsing. Besides the pleasant feel of the camera in my hand, it had an actually-wide wide-angle (28mm equivalent) and native 16::9 aspect ratio.</p>

<p>16::9 aspect exactly matches the format of newer widescreen movies and the Sony PSP, which I'd found to be an excellent venue for showing short video clips and lots of widescreen photos during the previous week's <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/">Game Developer's Conference</a> (where I'd been toting my Canon SLR) (weird trivia &#151; the camera itself is  16::9-shaped , which can be useful for thinking about composition even with the camera turned off (hold it up in front of you for a sec) &#151; and the camera is almost exactly the same size as the PSP screen). I read all the reviews I could find, looked at photos made by it, and then bought it. I have been happy.</p>

<p>This is the first non-phone camera I've had without an optical viewfinder. I know that <a href="http://www.leica-camera.com/discus_e/messages/3/197381.html?1140805022">some folks</a> have gone ahead and superglued a <a href="http://www.cameraquest.com/voigtacc.htm">28mm Voigtlander Minifinder</a> to the top of their DLux2 &#151; I understand it, that desire to raise the camera to your eye is a basic one. The camera is, after all, an extension of your eye...</p>

<p>Yet as much as I enjoy <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/camerahacks/">camera hacks,</a> this seems overboard. I like the LCD, though it is not nearly as immediate as a eye-level finder. Responding quickly to what's in front of the camera can be tricky &#151; it takes time for your eye to shift back and forth from the scene and the finder LCD, racking your internal focus back and forth as you do it. It can be a sort of barrier, and I'll mention how to help that further on.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bjorke/133979298/" title="Gaff1"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/55/133979298_919e8b0753_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="LX1 Hack #1 - Tape Controls" align="right" vspace=4 hspace=8 border=0 /></a><br />
I <i>have</i> gently hacked my own camera, using about $0.05 worth of gaffer tape (you knew I would get here eventually, right?). <a href="https://www.botzilla.com/blog/archives/000392.html">Gaffer tape</a> can definitely help the LX1, even if you get the camera in the svelte and low-visibility pewter. The first illustration shows two key aspects of the camera that can be enhanced by a little of the old G.T.</p>

<p>At the back, there's a triangle of black tape placed overlapping and below the little "grip nubs" that Panasonic has already provided for your thumb. The fabric of the tape is <i>much</i> better to grip, and it doesn't shift around so much when you're also trying to use your thumb on the controls. It's an improvmenet for two-handed and one-handed operation &#151; in fact the camera is almost too slippery for one-handed operation without this enhancement.</p>

<p>At the top, I've added a tiny strip of tape to the mode-select dial, laid in the blank space. It's directly opposite the "P," so when the camera is in "P" mode you can feel the line of tape squarely under your index finger. This makes it straightforward to set the camera not only to "P" mode but to <i>any</i> mode, once you're used to the order of the neighboring symbols. With the tape, modes can be selected purely by touch &#151; no looking at the dial or the LCD. This is invaluable for use in quick-paced or darkened situations. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bjorke/133979299/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/49/133979299_874942d174_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="LX1 Hack #2 - Tape Grip" align="left" vspace=4 hspace=8 border=0 /></a>The front of the camera can likewise use a little grip improvement &#151; placing two narrow pieces of tape as shown here improves the purchase of your middle finger when gripping. The difference in finger-slippage is really dramatic, compared to the smooth plastic surface under the tape. Remember, the LX1 is a very light camera &#151; it's easy for it to shift around in your hand without a good grip (unlike big metal 35mm's of old).</p>

<p>I got <a href="http://www.kbcamera.com/leicashop/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=73_3_394&products_id=2309&osCsid=d3868b2c332d0d8d9527171b0cc8887f">a great deal on a red Leica-badged Crumpler case</a>, which is sturdy nylon/cordura and has a wee pouch in front for carrying an extra battery and/or SD card. It can be carried on a shoulder strap (it's almost too light for that), on your belt, or the camera strap can stick out and you can just carry it as a "loose" case. The Crumpler is similar to the  <a href="http://www.lowepro.com/Products/Camera_Pouches/designed_digital/Ridge_30.aspx">Lowepro Ridge 30</a>, which is somewhat generic.</p>

<p>That  work colleague whose DLux2 helped inspire me to buy my LX1, has one of Luigi Crscenzi's luxurious <a href="http://www.leicatime.com/">LeicaTime</a> cases, which like the Crumpler is a snug rectangle, but unlike the Crumpler is fashioned from heavy  leather. Slightly less pragmatic-<i>looking,</i> lacking the same sorts of clips and mountaineering-inspired velcro bits, but beautifully made and the machine is well-protected.</p>

<p>Luigi also makes a "never-ready" style case, which you can see <a href="http://www.leica-camera.com/discus_e/messages/3/202051.html">here</a> &#151; Panasonic likewise makes <a href="http://www2.panasonic.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/vModelDetail?storeId=15001&catalogId=13401&itemId=96393&modelNo=PS-SLX1K&surfModel=PS-SLX1K&cacheProgram=11002&cachePartner=7000000000000005702">a slightly simpler one</a> for about $30, along with their own <a href="http://www2.panasonic.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/vModelDetail?storeId=15001&catalogId=13401&itemId=94142&cacheProgram=11002&cachePartner=7000000000000005702&surfModel=DMC-LX1K&catGroupId=24999&surfCategory=Lumix%AE&displayTab=A">pouch models.</a></p>

<p>I'm glad I got the Crumpler &#151; of all the cases I've seen it seems the most durable and useful.</p>

<p>The LX1 has a lens cap. This can potentially make it less-than-pocketable, compared to cameras that fully retract their lenses.  I've yet to have trouble with this. A danger, when pocketing the camera <i>sans</i> case, is that the cap will come loose in your pocket and the lens will be scratched. A solution I used before receiving my Crumpler &#151; keep the pocketed camera in a plastic ziploc sandwich bag, which keeps everything snug and doesn't let fabric or loose pens catch on the cap.</p>

<p>The lens is the star of the camera, I'm really impressed with its <a href="/blog/archives/000476.html">lack of distortion</a> and crisp results even wide-open. Pictures speak to its color and sharpness. It's only f/2.8 but the addition of "OIS" Image Stabilization gives it hand-holdability at pretty low speeds.</p>

<p>I leave my OIS in "Mode 1" (always on). The "Mode 2" (on just when you press the shutter) slows the camera down. Mode 2 supposedly saves battery life, but a second battery is trivial to carry. I've rarely needed it, even after a full day of snapping.</p>

<p><i>(It's been pointed out to me that Mode 2, though it does add shutter lag, is sometimes more stable than Mode 1, since Mode 2 always starts from the center "zero" position)</i></p>

<p>The controls are cramped. That's what happens when a device is tiny. The grip tape helps a lot, though occasionally I accidentally press the self-timer button (the <b>&lt;</b> arrow) at inopportune moments. Likewise, when reaching for the AF/AE lock button, it's easy to accidentally press the joystick (which jumps you to the "quick menu" &#151; invaluable when you need it, but camera-stopping when you don't). Practice is the only thing that can really help here.</p>

<p>At least one user on <a href="http://robgalbraith.com/">Galbraith's</a> has complained that the AE/AF lock button is disabled when the camera is in manual mode. They want it to act like Canon's CF4 custom function. Happily, in practice this is a non-issue.</p>

<p>The reason it's a non-issue is because unlike most any other compact digital I've seen, the MF mode is set by a slider on the side of the lens &#151; much like the AF selector on an EOS lens, but much easier to manage. Not a push button that resets when the camera is switched to another mode, nor a (yuck) menu item. It's physical, and it stays where you put it.</p>

<p>So if you're shooting in manual exposure, it's easy to just ignore the AF/AE-L button, and instead let the camera focus in AF and then flip the slider to MF, which effectively functions as an AF lock (with manual override, unlike the "regular" AF lock). It's easy to use <i>by feel</i> which is a big deal to me. I want to be looking at the scene, looking at the picture &#151; not busying my eyes reading menus and other on-screen junk (and that includes looking for the little AF/AE indicator). The more you can know about the camera's state <i>without</i> looking at it, the better. Let your eye look for pictures, not mode indicators.</p>

<p>The manual focus has another rare feature for a compact &#151; a depth of field indicator, indicated as a yellow band against the white range guide. Keen. </p>

<p>Using MF, the camera is very fast to respond to the shutter button. All good. Manual exposure, easy zone focus thanks to the DoF markers, fast shutter & 28mm view &#151; my kind of camera.</p>

<p>The flash is low-powered and uses a preflash, like Canon et al. I've rarely used it. There's no connection provided for controlling external strobes. This hasn't had much effect on my shooting either.</p>

<p>A lot of web-review trumpeting has been made about sensor noise at the higher ISOs in this camera, and return trumpets have sounded  about how great <a href"http://www.picturecode.com/">Noise Ninja</a> is at correcting for the noise. Both contentions are true. I like using RAW mode and correcting noise problems later, I have a good workflow set up for this.</p>

<p>A feature of the camera is that when in RAW mode, a <i>full size</i> JPEG is stored &#151; some folks have complained about this using too much space on the card (hey, extra 2GB cards are... what, $50-60 these days?). I like it. The JPEG serves as a good reminder of what you actually intended. I like that I can set the color process to B&W or sepia and the JPEG is stored using that setting, while the RAW file is... well, RAW, and contains all the original color information.</p>

<p>Beats me why the camera only supports USB 1.1 output. Ooops. I use an external USB 2.0 card reader, which is much, much faster.</p>

<p>I've finally become a convert to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/dng/main.html">Adobe DNG</a> &#151; it makes life simpler for people with multiple cameras to keep all the files in the same format. So the LX1 RAW files, the CRWs from the G5 or the DSLR, all can live together in peace. My digital workflow goes:</p>

<p><center>Card Reader &#151;&raquo; hard disk &#151;&raquo; DNG Convert &#151;&raquo; Adobe Bridge</center></p>

<p>and from there to Photoshop and an archive disk. I keep some LX1-dedicated Photoshop actions around, particularly one that labels pix with LX1-related flickr tags and copyrights, and another that can take 16::9 photos and ready-format them for the PSP.</p>

<p>This past week I received a <a href="http://panasonic.jp/dc/lx1/">Panasonic LX1</a>, my first non-Canon digital (other than a phone camera). Tiny, 8MP, Leica lens (essentially, it's identical to the <a href="http://www.leica-camera.com/digitalekameras/dlux2/index.html">Leica D-Lux2</a>) &#151; and 16::9 aspect ratio, which was the Big Deal for me. So far: though the pace is definitely slower (and the ISO's lower) than using a DSLR, as a pocketable high-quality camera: fantastico. Loving it.</p>

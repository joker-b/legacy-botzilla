        <p>Yes, it's happened: we've gotten the go-ahead to create and publish <cite><b>GPU Gems 3,</b></cite> and once more I'll be a section editor. <cite>GPU Gems</cite> has been the best-selling text on GPU rendering and computation since the first edition, I'm excited to be bringing it back along with the other editors at NVIDIA. Supervising editor this time 'round will be Hubert Nguyen, who besides his graphics experience is also chief editor of <a href="http://www.ubergizmo.com/">ubergizmo.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://developer.nvidia.com/object/gpu-gems-3-call-for-participation.html">Here's the official call for partipation.</a></p>
        <a name="more"></a>
        <p><i>Following the success of GPU Gems and GPU Gems 2, NVIDIA has decided to produce a third GPU Gems volume to showcase the best new ideas and techniques for the latest programmable GPUs. We were honored that GPU Gems won the 2004 Game Developer Front Line Award and that GPU Gems 2 was a Finalist in the 2005 Game Developer Front Line Awards. What's more, GPU Gems and GPU Gems 2 were the best-selling books at the Game Developer Conference and SIGGRAPH in their respective years.</p>

<p>This latest GPU Gems will, like previous volumes, be hardbound and in full color. Tentatively titled GPU Gems 3, it will be edited by Hubert Nguyen, Manager of Developer Education at NVIDIA. Nguyen contributed to previous GPU Gems volumes and brings to this role vast experience in the field of computer graphics. Section editors include a team of expert NVIDIA engineers: Cyril Zeller, Evan Hart, Ignacio Castano, Kevin Bjorke, Kevin Myers, and Nolan Goodnight.</p>

<p>NVIDIA is looking for innovative ideas from developers who are using GPUs in new ways to create stunning graphics and cutting-edge applications. GPU Gems 3 will present techniques and ideas that are broadly useful to GPU programmers and that can be integrated into their applications. And, it will continue the tradition of featuring chapters exploring non-graphics applications of the computational capabilities of GPU hardware (learn more at <a href="http://www.gpgpu.org/">www.GPGPU.org</a>). Because our goal is to provide a comprehensive set of authoritative and practical chapters, we strongly suggest submitting ideas about techniques that you have already developed and tested.</p>

<p>If you would like to contribute to the GPU Gems series, please read the following submission guidelines. The deadline for proposal submissions is Monday, December 11, 2006. If your proposal is accepted, you will receive additional time to complete the chapter.<br />
Guidelines for Chapter Proposal</p>

<p>Each chapter proposal should meet the following qualifications:</p>

<p>&#8226; <b>Subject.</b> Your chapter can be about any topic related to applying GPUs in useful and compelling ways. For example, you may choose to write about a specific shader or technique for rendering an interesting effect, or you could write about a strategy for integrating shaders into a game engine. Or, you might discuss an interesting way to apply the GPU's horsepower in a non-graphics area. The main requirement is that your subject has practical value for the community and that you are committed to writing a clear, concise, and informative chapter. </p>

<p>&#8226; <b>Submission.</b> Send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:articlesubmissions@nvidia.com">articlesubmissions@nvidia.com</a> with your proposed chapter title as the subject line, and a concise chapter description in the e-mail body (preferably no more than 300 words). To increase your chances of acceptance, we recommend that the description include screenshots or movies that demonstrate the technique in action. Ultimately, you must be able to provide a working program that demonstrates your technique. Complete source code is not necessarily required, though a self-contained example will be a plus.</p>

<p>&#8226; <b>Deadline.</b> We will be working on an aggressive schedule, so you must submit your proposal by Monday, December 11, 2006.</p>

<p>Notifications will be sent out by the end of the year. If your proposal is accepted, we will contact you via e-mail and discuss our expectations for the full chapter, as well as the next steps in the process. To assist you in finalizing your chapter, we will create your figures and provide copyediting services.<br />
Final Chapter Information</p>

<p>&#8226; <b>Length.</b> The final chapters should range from five to twenty pages of formatted book pages. This requirement accounts for figures, code samples, and page layout, so there would be approximately 200 to 300 words per page. In some cases, we may accept chapters that are shorter or longer than the suggested length, depending on the content. A chapter does not have to be long or complicated to be accepted. In fact, an idea that is simple and compelling is more likely to be accepted.</p>

<p>&#8226; <b>Rights.</b> You must have the right to publish your work, code and images (diagrams and screenshots).</p>

<p>We look forward to reading your submissions.</i></p>

<p>Four years ago I departed a good job at <a
    href="http://developer.nvidia.com" target="new">NVIDIA</a> to join a start-up
games company called <a href="http://www.trionworld.com" target="new">Trion World
    Network</a> -- Trion&rsquo;s plan was to revolutionize online
gaming in the US, and their stated goals were ones that I also shared:
to create a new, innovative, more-immersive and immediate online-gaming
experience.</p>

<p>I really believe that graphics matter. That great art is
more than just simulating realism, and that it goes right to
your emotions without waiting for rational analysis. That
it&rsquo;s those emotions that bring you back again and again
to entertaining experiences, more than DPS and EXP and
leveling-up to get the next BFG. Those are just background. Beautiful, vivid imagery -- even a beautiful image of an ugly subject
-- goes right to the heart of an audience&rsquo;s mind.</p>

<p>Among
games, online ones had to that point been rather poor cousins
in the graphics and art departments, with titles like
<i>Farmville</i> and <i>World of Warcraft.</i> I&rsquo;d had
conversations with developers of other online games who
declared &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t want to do anything more than
Blizzard is doing&rdquo; -- instead of seeing a future of
ubiquitously-cheaper and more powerful machines for
entertainment, they could only see that <i>WoW</i> had
millions of subscribers &amp; thought the only way to proceed
was via a zero-sum &nbsp;&ldquo;WWWD?&rdquo; -- &ldquo;What
Would <i>WoW</i> Do?&rdquo; -- mindset.</p>

<p>Given the fact that game development cycles are now often longer
than hardware-deployment cycles (a next generation of hardware may
appear every year or so, while games to use that hardware take much
longer), this vision gap was increasingly obvious. The future was
being held back by a desire to simply repeat the successes of the
past.</p>

<p>From my evangelist/consulting role at NVIDIA, it seemed like the
shortest route to really show people what a <a
    href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/nvision08-bwotf.html" target="new">beautiful
    online game experience</a> might be like was not to advise the
established developers, but to lead by doing: to simply go and create the
future myself. And so I jumped, just hours before the stock market crash of
2008 got fully underway.</p>

<p>Two and a half years later, <a
    href="http://www.riftgame.com/" target="new"><i>Rift: Planes of Telara</i></a> opened to <a href="http://www.gamerankings.com/pc/995594-rift/index.html" target="new">rave reviews;</a> reviews that nearly always began with accolades about how great the game looked (<a href="http://www.tentonhammer.com/rift/features/review" target="new">Ten Ton Hammer:</a> Graphics 95, &ldquo;outstanding&rdquo;; <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/reviews/8795-Rift-Review" target="new">The Escapist:</a> &ldquo;One area where Rift&nbsp;definitely delivers is the graphics&rdquo;; <a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/12/02/why-you-should-care-about-rift-planes-of-telara" target="new">IGN:</a> &ldquo;an undeniably gorgeous game&rdquo;; etc).</p>

<p>We continued to ramp it up for future revisions: so much so that
previewers of &nbsp;the first expansion set, <i>Rift: Storm Legion,</i>
expressed their excitement about the &ldquo;new renderer&rdquo; (there
was no new renderer, but I&rsquo;d upgraded nearly all of the lighting
and atmospherics code). When the expansion was released it received
similar critical praise, such as this <a
    href="http://gamingtrend.com/game_reviews/rift-storm-legion-review-everything-you-want-in-an-expansion/" target="new">review
    from <i>Gaming Trend:</i></a> &ldquo;[<i>Storm Legion</i> has]
<i>the best looking things in gaming, period, right now.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p><b><i>Quest Completed! You are dead.</i></b></p>

<p>However, the executives at Trion had a very different view. In
December 2012, just a very few weeks after the release of <i>Storm
    Legion,</i> despite the superlative reception, they laid off a big chunk (most?)
of the remaining <i>Rift</i>-focused art team: forty people including
myself. If I were to speculate, the company seems to be backing away
from &ldquo;Triple-A&rdquo; content focus and moving toward licensing
deals with other production companies along with a focus on smaller,
faster-iterating projects. Less &ldquo;vision of the future of
entertainment&rdquo; and more same-ol&rsquo; game publishing.
That&rsquo;s just speculation on my part, but they&rsquo;ve certainly
reduced their ability to create top-shelf experiences like <i>Rift</i> in the
short term future. Speculation.</p>

<p>While I&rsquo;m not happy with the choices of management, I hope
<i>Rift</i> continues to find an audience -- the whole point was to
make something worth showing and sharing, a better gaming experience
than what had been offered by anyone before. The effort means nothing
if no one gets to experience the world we&rsquo;ve created.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also decided to write a series here on some of the
challenges and solutions in my process of collaboratively creating and
tweaking the artwork and graphics for the game. While most of the art
department has already been publicizing their work, as in this <a
    href="http://www.polycount.com/forum/showthread.php?t=112686" target="new">Polycount
    Art Dump,</a> we were specifically forbidden from revealing
&ldquo;technical details.&rdquo; Which means that if your work is
nearly <i>all</i> technical details, well... you&rsquo;re not allowed to talk
about your work! Now I can. Watch this space.</p></body></html>

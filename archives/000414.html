        <p><a href="https://www.botzilla.com/photo/Fam/swan.html"><img title="Swan Trampouline Princess, (C)1994 K Bjorke" src="https://www.botzilla.com/blog/pix2007/swanx-small.jpg" class="pull-right" border="0" /></a>While this post has been lingering half-written for months, I was reminded of it this morning, as I came across <a href="http://suzannerevy.blogspot.com/2007/08/mirrors-and-windows.html">this post from Suzanne Revy,</a> and prodded with the notion that in fact this little rant has been curdling in my mind for my, much longer.</p>

<p>Suzanne is one of an undeclared informal group, <i>the <a href="http://www.apug.org/">APUG</a> B&W Child Portrait Society,</i> a club that includes photographers like <a href="http://www.cheryljacobsphotography.com/">Cheryl Jacobs</a>  in the U.S., <a href="http://www.nicoleboenigmcgrade.com/">Nicole Boenig-McGrade</a> in Australia, & <a href="http://www.kuvakonttuuri.fi/">Heli Huhtala</a> in Finland. </p>

<p>In all these cases we see similar sorts of classic iconography being used to similar means: to reveal, or seem to reveal, a private world in which children are fully involved and which adults can only glimpse. Even then, the <i>contents</i> of that private world remains hidden -- only its existence is shown, and the rest is hidden through deep shadows and restrictive or soft focus (or even, as in Cheryl's current title-webpage image, both shadows and soft focus combined with a wire mesh screen between the child and the photographer).</p>

<p>As Jeff Curto describes well in his <a href="http://www.cod.edu/photo/curto/1105/podcasts/Photo%20History%20-%20Class%2011%20Spring%2007%20-%20Women%20in%20Photography.m4a">Podcast Lecture on Women in Photographic History</a> (you can find his associated presentation slides <a href="http://www.cod.edu/photo/curto/1105/slides/women/index.htm">here</a>),  these veins have been serving-up images of value almost since the dawn of photography. As Curto also mentions, they have been especially well-represented by women photographers, with few men making such leaps -- a bit like his parallel observation that there are almost no woman landscape photographers of note. The iconic photographers with similar visual flavor are certainly women: <a href="http://www.arthistory.sbc.edu/artartists/photosally.html">Sally Mann</a>, <a href="http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/1aa/1aa253.htm">Chansonetta Stanely Emmons</a>, <a href="http://wirtzgallery.com/exhibitions/2000/exhibitions_2000_09/rexroth/exhibitions_nr_2000_09_images.html">Nancy Rexroth</a>, and of course <a href="http://www.iphf.org/inductees/gkasebier.html">Gertrude Kasebier,</a> whom I've often felt was the first prominent photographer of this sort whose work was acclaimed to a degree because she delivered what was expected, following in the far larger footsteps of <a href="http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artMakerDetails?maker=2026">Julia Margaret Cameron</a> (caveat: both made images approriate for their time, and I acknowledge that my reading is based on a potentially ignorance-inducing gap of over a century).</p>

<p>There are a handful of exceptions, particularly moderns like <a href="http://www.keithcarterphotographs.com/">Keith Carter</a> (is Ralph Gibson an adult alternative?), or stray iconic images like Elliot Erwitt's <a href="http://www.jmcfaber.at/images/erwitt03.jpg">nursing mother</a> or W. Eugene Smith's postcard perennial <a href="http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://imagecache2.allposters.com/images/pic/IMC/g1801~Walk-to-Paradise-Garden-Posters.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.allposters.com/-sp/Walk-to-Paradise-Garden-Posters_i325202_.htm&h=450&w=338&sz=41&hl=en&start=2&um=1&tbnid=zHMJQ50ZESVKDM:&tbnh=127&tbnw=95&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dsmith%2Bparadise%2Bgarden%26svnum%3D10%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26sa%3DN">Walk Through Paradise Garden</a>, pictures that are notable for <i>not</i> being the work for which those photographers are acclaimed, regardless of whatever commercial success those individual pictures have found (Erwitt has commented that his snap, made of his wife & baby daughter, essentially paid for that daughter's college education).</p>

<p><center><a href="https://www.botzilla.com/photo/2001/bat.html"><img title="(C)1995" src="https://www.botzilla.com/blog/pix2007/batman-07.jpg" class="img-responsive"  border="0"  /></a></center></p>

<p>There are a few men approaching but skirting past this dream landscape. An obvious example and another APUG wanderer might be Napa's <a href="http://www.michaelmcblane.com/">Michael McBlane,</a> whose black and whites similarly revel in the beauty of children's clear faces in soft light but like most male portraitists seems a bit more formal, more distanced, more willing to work in the studio... dare I say a more results-oriented approach?</p>

<p>It's not hard to think similarly of <a href="http://photography.about.com/library/weekly/aa052200a.htm">Nicholas Nixon's</a> family photography, which reveals its emotional core only through a formal approach and his relentlessly demanding mastery of large-format technique.</p>

<p>What then might be a typical male approach? Surely father love their children as dearly as mothers do. <i>Is</i> there a "typical" stance? And if so, what role does the gender of the photographer play, where are its strengths, its soft spots? I ask myself this while looking at pictures like the above, pictures I made when my children were small and when, as a newly-single dad, perhaps (<i>perhaps</i>) I had no choice but to me Mr Mom in practice and in spirit. Have my pictures changed since then, in a way that reflects more than just the greater age (and diminished patience) of these two beautiful subjects?</p>

<p>One of the more interesting dad photographers is one I actually know: <a href="http://www.todddeutsch.com/">Todd Deutsch,</a> who manages to find his own view with a lightweight fluid camera in photos like <a href="http://todddeutsch.com/blog/?p=43">this one.</a> </p>

<p>Conclusions? None. Then again, I prefer photos that are questions.</p>

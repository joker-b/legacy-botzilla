<p>For my Contact Photo weekend, I'd expected the Sunday to be the shorter of the two -- instead under the bright sun I was able to visit <a href="http://www.mocca.toronto.on.ca/">MOCCA,</a> the remaining Queen Street galleries, the <a href="http://www.gladstonehotel.com/exhibitions.cfm">Gladstone,</a> the <a href="http://www.thedrakehotel.ca/">Drake,</a> drive across town to the <a href="http://www.corkingallery.com/">Corkin,</a> and still take a leisurely pace back to the airport.</p>

<p>Of the work I saw, there were only a few standouts, but they were well worth the trouble...</p>
        <a name="more"></a>
        <p>My vote for most under-appreciated were Wilma Needham's prints at <a href="http://www.new-gallery.ca/">New Gallery,</a> a space that was quite empty the two times I visited. The prints have a sense of disconnection and depth that, for me, made vivid  senses of physicality, of mortality, and yet from them a great, simple beauty. </p>

<p>I was happily surprised to find that <a href="http://www.ryokobo.com/">Ryoko Suzuki's</a> <a href="http://www.ryokobo.com/contents/anikora2.html"><i>Anikora-seifuku</i></a> prints were really as great as their size (and prices) might indicate -- a benefit of their scale is that the photographic reproduction of the small hand-painted <i>anikora</i> dolls, when on a six-foot print, give the impression that the surface of the print itself has been painted. From the catalog I noticed that a few of these prints had already been tagged "sold" -- the most conservative ones in my opinion, which gave me the impression that the buyers must have been institutions.</p>

<p>A bonus while at the Corkin was picking up a signed <a href="http://www.photoeye.com/templates/ShowDetailsbyCat.cfm?Catalog=id499"><i>Photo Poche</i></a> by <a href"http://coincidences.typepad.com/still_images_and_moving_o/2004/12/sarah_moons_cir.html">Sarah Moon,</a> who I have long admired and  think of as one of the key figures, though she has never (afaik) used one, in the iconography of modern toy camera users.</p>

<p>At the Gladstone, the most appealing work was in the collective <a href="http://www.gladstonehotel.com/exhibitiondetail.cfm?id=174"><i>Exposed</i></a> show -- not across the board, but a few of the photographers there had compelling voices. One, <a href="http://www.gladstonehotel.com/exhibitiondetail.cfm?id=174">Jimm Tran,</a> showed work that was <i>nothing</i> like the event and wedding portfolio he displays on the web: instead he had a series of fantasy portrayals of "american dreamgirl" scenarios as created in a low-budget way by a young southeast-asian transvestite. One might think it just an <i>épater le bourgeois</i> gesture, but genuinely I found the work touching, a collision of impossible (or at least implausible) cultural and personal ambitions and expectations.</p>

<p>In the same show I enjoyed the color styling of <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/littlealien">Tammy Hoy,</a> though her subjects seemed painfully reminiscent of artists like the Parke-Harrisons and obviously an iconic bowler hat borrowed from Magritte. A real standout were the <i>fictographie</i> prints of <a href="http://jeromebourque.com/">Jérôme Bourque.</a> The other work in the group show was decent enough -- perhaps becasue it was all part of a group and no one collection needed to carry the show. The other, single-artists shows at the Gladstone left me feeling cold, including the appealing surfaces of <a href="http://www.gladstonehotel.com/exhibitiondetail.cfm?id=507">I Am Elvis</a> -- too slick, too designed to please, too <i>Entertainment Magazine</i> for my taste.</p>

<p>A curious aspect of a show like Contact is that, as I hear it, if you can set up photos in your garage and pay $400, you can hang a yellow tag outside and call yourself a Contact site. While this doesn't fly well among the main gallery rows, I was surprised (well, not really) to find not far from the Corkin a small (and busy) gallery, complete with a Contact tag, full of photos that were classic, colorful photo.net standards -- vine-surrounded doorways, archways, late-day-lit and person-less travel fare of old buildings in Provence (or was it Venice? Does it matter?). Who will sell more dollar volume by the end of the show -- the $6k Suzuki prints or the $600 generica? Hmmm.</p>
